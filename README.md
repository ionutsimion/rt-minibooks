# Ray Tracing Minibooks
This is an application inspired by the three books from the **Ray Tracing Minibooks**, by Peter Shirley:
* Ray Tracing in One Weekend
* Ray Tracing: The Next Weekend
* Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life

Information about the books and links to the (now) free books can be found [here](https://raytracing.github.io/).

The end result should be the same (or very similar), but the approach will bi slightly different - at least, that's the plan.
